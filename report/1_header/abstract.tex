This project provides an estimate for the number of quantum gates required to implement Shor's Algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem over hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 in polynomial time. We conclude that the problem can be solved on a quantum circuit with at most $11n+2\lceil\log_2n\rceil+10$ qubits, with a gate count in the order of $1472n^3\log_2n$, which ultimately leads to a circuit which has a lower overall gate count than both elliptic curves and RSA. The circuit for both RSA and elliptic curves would require $\sim1000$ qubits, whereas the circuit for hyperelliptic curves of equivalent security would require $\sim600$.
