This project provides an estimate for the number of quantum gates required to implement Shor's Algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem over hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 in polynomial time. We conclude that our result of $480n^3\log_2n$ is more costly than the case for elliptic curves: $448n^3\log_2n$, and less costly than RSA, which requires a larger bit-size for equivalent security.
