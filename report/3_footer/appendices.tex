I have included a .zip folder, which contains some sage worksheets, and some {LIQU}i|> code in F\#. The sage worksheets were for the gate cost calculations, and an implementation of hyperelliptic curve arithmetic to help me understand it better. The {LIQU}i|> code is an attempt at creating a 5 bit full adder as a quantum circuit, in attempts to eventually creating a quantum circuit which simulated hyperelliptic curve addition. It is not complete due to time constraints. I also used {LIQU}i|> to simulate a run of shor's alrgorithm applied to the factorisation problem.
I have also included a copy of the code available at \url{https://git-teaching.cs.bham.ac.uk/mod-ug-proj-2018/sxf546}
\subsection{Instructions to run code}
Both the sage worksheets can be run in any sage compilation environment, I used the Cocalc online compiler, which can be found at \url{https://cocalc.com/}. To use this, you must first create an account, then import my worksheets to a project.
The {LIQU}i|> code will require a download of the {LIQU}i|> software, which can be found at \url{http://stationq.github.io/Liquid/}. The factorisation code is included with the example code as a function called \_\_shor(). The user manual for {LIQU}i|> can be found at \url{http://stationq.github.io/Liquid/docs/LIQUiD.pdf}.
